# Client Side (React)

This is the client-side of my personal website. It is built using **React.js** to provide a fast, interactive, and responsive user interface.

## Features

- Single Page Application (SPA) with smooth navigation.
- Responsive design, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- Integration with the server-side API for dynamic data rendering.
- Modern UI/UX using React hooks and components.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js**: Front-end framework.
- **Axios**: For API communication with the backend.
- **React Router**: For routing and navigation.
- **CSS/SASS**: For styling the application (optional if you used a CSS framework).
